About the Employer

Located in northern California Wine Country, the Ukiah Unified School District serves approximately 6,000 students, from preschoolers through adults. The district includes six elementary schools, two middle schools, and a comprehensive high school. In addition, our district offers an early education preschool, independent learning opportunities for elementary and high school students, an alternative education high school, and an adult learning center. Located in Mendocino County, Ukiah has countless wineries, is a short drive to the coast, and is surrounded by redwood forests. Our employees enjoy the best of California in a welcoming and caring community.

When you join Ukiah Unified, you become part of an amazing and vibrant community. We have wonderful assets for raising a family, including Near & Arnold’s School of Performing Arts & Cultural Education (SPACE), an acclaimed afterschool performing arts program serving youth ages infant through 18. The program emphasizes diversity, youth leadership, cross-cultual arts, social issues, and exemplary training in the arts. We’re adjacent to Sonoma County and the culinary epicenter of Healdsburg. A farm-to-table lifestyle is possible thanks to the abundant agricultural resources in and around Ukiah. Imagine access to orchards, fresh fruit, vegetables, artisan olive oils, farm-fresh artisan cheese, wild-caught seafood, and the top wineries in the country. And, of course, community-supported schools where education and educators are valued. Plus, Mendocino County and the city of Ukiah offer some of the most affordable housing in California! We invite you to apply to be part of Ukiah Unified and our wonderful community.
